# The goal of this scenario is to demostrate how flux can help sync a version control repository and a cluster. #

In order to sync your cluster state with git, you will need to create a deploy key with write access on GitHub repository. This means that you will need to work on your own GitHub repository. You can fork from [this repository](https://github.com/gonzalobarbitta/flux-training).
